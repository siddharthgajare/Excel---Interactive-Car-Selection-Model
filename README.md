# Car Selection Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to build a recommendation system to assist users in finding the right car based on their preferences. It collects user input on budget, fuel economy, cargo capacity needs, and horsepower preferences. The system provides initial car suggestions, displays key specifications of suggested cars, and refines recommendations based on additional user preferences.

## Methodology

- **User Input:** Collects preferences on budget, fuel economy, cargo capacity, and horsepower.
- **Initial Suggestions:** Provides initial car suggestions based on user input.
- **Key Specifications:** Displays specifications like cost, fuel economy, cargo capacity, horsepower, etc., of suggested cars.
- **Refinement:** Collects additional user preferences to refine recommendations.

## Key Findings

- Dataset includes specifications of over 15 car models (brands: Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, etc.).
- Users can input budget ($20k-$100k), fuel economy preferences, cargo needs, and horsepower preferences.
- Initial top suggestions: Lexus LS, Genesis G90, BMW 7 Series, Mercedes C-Class, etc.
- Users can rate attributes and provide additional preferences for personalized recommendations.

## Excel Skills Used

- **Data Manipulation:** Used Excel for collecting and organizing user input data.
- **Formulae:** Implemented algorithms to calculate car recommendations based on user criteria.
- **Visualization:** Excel was used to present key car specifications in a user-friendly manner.

## Conclusion

This project showcases a basic recommendation system for car selection, utilizing Excel for data manipulation, formulae, and visualization. With more data and advanced algorithms, such systems can offer highly personalized car recommendations.
