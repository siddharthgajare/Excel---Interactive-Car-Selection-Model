# Car Selection Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to build a recommendation system to assist users in finding the right car based on their preferences. It collects user input on budget, fuel economy, cargo capacity needs, and horsepower preferences. The system provides initial car suggestions, displays key specifications of suggested cars, and refines recommendations based on additional user preferences.
